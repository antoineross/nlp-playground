This folder serves as a playground for NLP learning specifically in `hugging-face`. The following are studied:
1. HuggingFace NLP Diffusion pipeline. (transfomers-overview/)
2. Fine Tuning a model using Trainer API (PyTorch) or through Keras (Tensorflow). (fine-tuning/)
3. Fully Customized Training Loop without using Trainer API. (fine-tuning/)
4. Sharing a model through HuggingFace Hub. (huggingface-hub/)
5. Creating a dataset and pushing it to HuggingFace Hub. (huggingface-hub/)
6. A deep dive into tokenizers. Tokenizers from scratch. (tokenizers/)
7. NLP Projects. (projects/)
